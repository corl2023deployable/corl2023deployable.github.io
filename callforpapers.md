We welcome submissions on all topics in robot learning, but particularly favor those addressing algorithmic and practical challenges in deploying learning-based systems in the real world.

Submissions should be anonymized and have a maximum of 8 pages. They can follow one of the following formats: CoRL, ICRA, ICLR, or NeurIPS. Additionally, we encourage authors to include videos, code, or data as supplementary material either in a zip file or through external anonymized links.

Accepted papers will be presented either as posters or orals, and will be archived on the workshop website with the authors' consent. All papers will be presented on-site during the workshop. At this time, we are not planning to accommodate remote presentation options.
